# BNB Agent Marketplace

Find, verify, compare, and hire AI agents on BNB Smart Chain.

This repository contains a new standalone marketplace being built for the Build the Era hackathon. It extends existing ERC-8004 indexing and reputation infrastructure from [trust8004.xyz](https://trust8004.xyz), while introducing a BSC-specific marketplace data model, four-category discovery, proof of hireability, and an ERC-8183 buyer journey.

## Product thesis

Agent registries prove that an identity exists. This marketplace aims to prove that an agent is reachable, suitable for a task, and actually hireable.

```text
Registered
    → Reachable
    → Capabilities verified
    → Quote verified
    → ERC-8183 job funded
    → Delivery proven
```

## Main track scope

The marketplace treats all four required categories as first-class:

- Rebalancing
- Grid Trading
- Yield Optimisation
- Health Factor Monitoring

The critical journey is:

```text
Discover → Understand → Compare → Configure → Quote → Fund → Run → Result
```

## Current status

Gate 0: repository and provenance setup.

The first technical milestone is an ERC-8183 buyer spike. A complete visual marketplace will not be built until the hiring lifecycle works end to end.
